My name is Mohsin Farooq and I like building shit.

I earned a Bachelors/Masters in the Computer Engineering from Rochester Institue of Technology (RIT). Since then I've worked as a software engineer at (Citi, Intel, Amazon, Square). I took a year off in 2023-2024 to work on personal projects ranging from building physical things like a hottub, cabinets, a shed, bathroom to creating tech that I thought was interesting (BetaShare, QuickAPI, VoiceOver).
