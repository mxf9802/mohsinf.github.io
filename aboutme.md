### My story

I Bachelors and Masters in the Computer Engineering department at Rochester Institue of Technology (RIT). Since then I've worked (interned/full-time) as a software engineer at (Citi, Intel, Amazon, Square). I took at year off in 2023 to work on personal projects ranging from building physical things like hottubs, cabinets, sheds, bathrooms to creating tech that I thought was interesting (BetaShare, QuickAPI, VoiceOver).
