It started as a weekend project (of course) where I wanted to free up space in my garage workshop because there were too many things in there. I initially proposed to my girlfriend that we could just get a costco shed and put it up on the side of the house and store all the lawn equipment in there but she hated how it looked. Thatâ€™s when I said, alright bet, and proceeded to spend a few weeks building a significantly larger shed. This was my first time framing anything and I wanted to feel what it felt like framing houses back in the day so I did most of the framing with just a hammer. Suffice to say, I bought a nail gun for the sheathing.
