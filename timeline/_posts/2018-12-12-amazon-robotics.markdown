Helped implement and lead development efforts of a robotic arm workcell. Implemented generalized
work APIs using now open-source IDL Smithy that could be reused across different robotic workcell
types. Designed and implemented an orchestrator that used these APIs and work models to orchestrate
multiple robotic workcells to automate a process. Mentored other engineers and conducted 20+ engineering
interviews.
